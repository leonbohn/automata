/// Represents the normalization of an [`OmegaWord`] with regard to a transition system `T`. For an ultimately periodic word
/// `ux^ω`, we say that `T` is normalized if `u` and `ux` lead to the same state in `T`, which means that `x` loops on the state
/// that is reached after reading `u`.
///
/// For every transition system `T` and any ultimately periodic word `w = ux^ω`, there exists a unique minimal normalization of
/// `w` with regard to `T`. Moreover, this normalization can be efficiently computed in polynomial time.
///
/// # Example
/// Let `T` be a transition system that has two states (0 and 1), each of those has a self-loop on a symbol `b` and `a`-transitions lead
/// back and forth between the two states. Consider a word `w = ba^ω`, meaning `u = b` and `x = a`. Clearly `w` is not normalized wrt `T`
/// since `u` leads to `0` while `x` leads to `1`. The normalization of `w` wrt `T` would be `b(aa)^ω` since `aa` loops on the state `0`
/// that is reached after reading `b` from the initial state `0`.
